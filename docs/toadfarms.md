**Toad Farms**

TOAD Farms (BNB and BUSD), distribute liquid in a similar fashion over drips as the LPF of developer donated liquidity.
These drip 1% remaining donated TOAD per day. There is no tax on these farms.

We believe these systems to be the fairest and most user incentivizing way to distribute a projects liquidity.
Incentivization to hold, and stake liquidity are paired with free market choices to seek higher yields and refresh the DPLP.

**How to add liquidity to toad.network Farms**

Liquidity for toad.network was added on V1 PancakeSwap's liquidity pools, hence, in order to be capable of adding liquidity to these farms you will have to head to PCS and change the liquidity to V1 liquidity and swap options. Once there, you'll have to provide same amount (USD value) of both of the chosen tokens and approve the spend.

After the transaction succeeds, you'll be provided with the corresponding LP tokens.

Head to toad.network and look for the corresponding farm of your LP tokens, approve the farm (so that you can provide liquidity), write down the amount you want to place and click on deposit. Once you have approved the deposit, you'll start earning TOADS by the second, based on the amount of LP tokens you provided and the current amount of TOADS available and the percentage of the pool that you own.

In case you find any issues with the pancakeswap interface, TOAD DEVS cloned the site and have made available another site that you can use for the same:
