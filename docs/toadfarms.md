**Toad Farms**

TOAD Farms (BNB and BUSD), distribute liquid in a similar fashion over drips as the LPF of developer donated liquidity.
These drip 1% remaining donated TOAD per day. There is no tax on these farms.

We believe these systems to be the fairest and most user incentivizing way to distribute a projects liquidity.
Incentivization to hold, and stake liquidity are paired with free market choices to seek higher yields and refresh the DPLP.
