**Toad Farms**

TOAD Farms (BNB and BUSD), distribute liquid through daily drips, similar to the LPF's drip of developer donated liquidity.
These rewards drip 1%  of the remaining donated or fee-accrued TOAD per day. There is no tax on these farms.

We believe these systems to be the fairest and most user-incentivizing way to distribute a project's liquidity.
Incentivization to hold and stake liquidity are paired with free market incentives to seek higher yields and refresh the DPLP.
