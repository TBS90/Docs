# What is PadSwap?

PadSwap is an all-in-one service that combines a decentralized exchange, a staking platform, and a launchpad that will allow users to launch their own token in a few clicks.

If you have used any swap service (e.g. Uniswap), you'll find that PadSwap will function relatively the same. But upon closer inspection, there's something that benefits ordinary users as well as projects that want to get listed on PadSwap.

On most decentralized exchanges, a large portion of the swap fee goes directly to the devs, resulting in higher transaction fees and less LP rewards for users.
On PadSwap, there is **no dev fee**.
This enables us to have higher rewards for Liquidity Providers, and still have a lower swap fee than many of our competitors.  
Out of the 0.3% swap fee, 0.25% goes towards LP rewards, and 0.05% goes into [the Vault](vault.md) to create an ever-rising price floor for PAD.

In addition to higher LP rewards, users can stake their LP tokens in a wide variety of [farms](farms.md) and earn PAD, the native token of PadSwap that is backed by tokens in [the Vault](vault.md).
Our goal is to make [farming](farms.md) as user-friendly as possible, incentivizing more users to provide liquidity and making the liquidity truly decentralized.

By creating synergy between its components, we want to create a fair, self-sustaining ecosystem that benefits everyone.
