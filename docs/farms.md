**Farms**

At this moment we can distinguish between two types of farms:

- LP farms, which rewards are given in the same LP tokens that were provided. These farms have much higher entry and exit fee (10%) and they are aimed to long term project supporters.
- Standard farms, which entry and exit fees are much lower and return the reward in the form of a single token.

You can gain more detail about LP Farms heading to [DPLP page](dplp.md)

There is more information about TOAD farms [here](toadfarms.md) and more about padswap farms [here](padfarms.md).
