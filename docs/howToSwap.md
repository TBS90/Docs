#**How to swap tokens in padswap.exchange DAPP**

**padswapping**

padswap has also some liquidity pools available for swaps. If you want to check which of them are available, you can check at [padswap pairs stats](https://info.padswap.exchange/pairs) for the available ones.

Apart from the well known tokens (BTC, ETH and, of course, BNB), there are some partners tokens already in there, all available to swap and also, of course, to provide [liquidity](liquidity.md) to. Remember that, for every swap that happens on padswap, part of the fee (a total of 0,3%) is redirected to the liquidity providers (0,25%) and the rest (0,05%) is redirected [The Vault](vault.md), making the ecosystem much safer and stable.

 PadSwap smart contracts are the safest and fairest smart contracts you'll ever find, as they are build with donated liquidity from the DEVS and reward liquidity providers which are farming this liquidity with the highest percent in the blockchain.

#**How to swap tokens padswap.exchange**

[PAD](padtoken.md) has its liquidity on custom audited smart contracts developed by the ToadNetwork team following the secure design of the PadSwap Liquidity Pool contract.

In broad words, here is how to swap any token available within the padswap project:

Head to the "exchange" area of "trade" on [padswap.exchange](https://padswap.exchange/#/swap), connect your wallet, choose the source token on the upper list and the amount you want to swap. Select the destination token you want to receive and the dapp will automaticalliy calculate the corresponding amount based on the AMM rules. If you are happy with the swap, click on swap. A detailed transaction screen will be presented, accept the proposal and then approve the transaction in you wallet.

After the transaction succeeds, you'll be provided with the corresponding tokens.

Let's look into a more detailed view on what needs to be done.
