**Toad token**

Toad token was released on the BSC on Friday, 26th of February with a fixed amount of 200.000 TOAD tokens.

There is no possibility to mint more TOAD.

Conceived as a governance token, has a very low supply, and will see significant buyback pressure from the vault.

TOAD aims to empower the [ToadNetwork](toadnetwork.md) community to participate in the protocol decisions, like:

  • Becoming and electing next ToadNetwork treasurer, who will be enhanced with the responsibility of being the third part on the multisignature contracts for [padswap](padswap.md).
  • Bring and vote new proposals.
  • Determine fee’s ratios directed to both the Vault and farms rewards.
  • Marketing / Development endeavors.
