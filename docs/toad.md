**TOAD Token**

Toad token was released on the BSC on Friday, 26th of February with a fixed amount of 200.000 TOAD tokens.

There is no possibility to mint more TOAD.

Conceived as a governance token, has a very low supply, and will see significant buyback pressure from the vault.

TOAD aims to empower the [TOAD.Network](toadnetwork.md) community to participate in the protocol decisions, like:

  • Nominating, electing, and even becoming the next TOAD.Network treasurer. The Treasurer will be tasked with the responsibility of being the third part on the multisignature contracts for [PADSwap](padswap.md) and will represent the users as such.
  • Bring and vote on new proposals.
  • Determine fee ratios directed to both the Vault and farms/pools rewards.
  • Marketing / Development endeavors.
