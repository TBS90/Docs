#**How to provide Liquidity for TOAD**

**TOAD Token liquidity**

Toad has distributed its liquidity among two different smart contracts, one is on a PCS V1 Liquidity Pool contract and another on the more secure PadSwap Liquidity Pool contract.

Head to [liquidity](liquidity.md) for more details about liquidity.

Depending on the farms you are wanting to be, you'll have to provide liquidity on a different one.

If you are planning to build strong positions on the [padswap](padswap.md) ecosystem, then the place to provide liquidity is on padswap.exchange, where you'll have your liquidity set up in the more robust and secure contract setup by the DEV team. Head to [add liquidity on PadSwap](addLiquidityForPadSwap.md) for more details on that.

There are some other videos also that might help on the topic, you'll find them below:

If you want to provide liquidity on the [toad](toadfarms.md) farms, hence earn some more TOADs, then proceed as follows:

#**How to add liquidity to toad.network Farms**

Liquidity for toad.network was added on V1 PancakeSwap's liquidity pools, hence, in order to be capable of adding liquidity to these farms you will have to head to PCS and change the liquidity to V1 liquidity and swap options.

Once there, you'll have to provide same amount (USD value) of both of the chosen tokens and approve the spend on the pair.

After the transaction succeeds, you'll be provided with the corresponding LP tokens.

Head to toad.network and look for the corresponding farm of your LP tokens, approve the farm (so that you can provide liquidity), write down the amount you want to place and click on deposit. Once you have approved the deposit, you'll start earning TOADS by the second, based on the amount of LP tokens you provided and the current amount of TOADS available and the percentage of the pool that you own.

In case you find any issues with the pancakeswap interface, TOAD DEVS cloned the site and have made available another site that you can use for the same purpose.

##**Providing liquidity for TOAD on the PCS clone**
- Navigate to toad.network site, expand the "trade" menu and click on PancakeSwap:

- Once you are on the site, you'll be prompted with a warning about how anyone can create a token. The link provided is configured to automatically choose the right one for the swap/liquidity providing, hence here you should be fine. Anyway, for your safety, you will be able lately to double check TOAD token Address (0x463e737d8f740395abf44f7aac2d9531d8d539e9) to confirm you are good.
