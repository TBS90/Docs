#**How to provide Liquidity for TOAD**

**TOAD Token liquidity**

TOAD.Network has distributed its liquidity among two different smart contracts: 
1) a PancakeSwap V1 Liquidity Pool contract 
2) the more secure PadSwap Liquidity Pool contract.

Head to [liquidity](liquidity.md) for more details about liquidity.

Depending on the farms you choose, you will have to provide liquidity on a different farm.

If you are planning to build strong positions on the [padswap](padswap.md) ecosystem, the place to provide liquidity is padswap.exchange. There you will have your liquidity in the more robust and secure contract setup by the DEV team. Head to [add liquidity on PadSwap](addLiquidityForPadSwap.md) for more details on this.

Here are some videos that provide more specific information on this topic:

If you want to provide liquidity on the [TOAD](toadfarms.md) farms (and earn some more TOADs) then follow these steps:

#**How to add liquidity to TOAD.network Farms**

Liquidity for TOAD.network was added on V1 PancakeSwap's liquidity pools. Therefore, in order to be able to add liquidity to these farms you must head to PancakeSwap and change the liquidity to "V1 liquidity and swap options".

Once there, you will have to provide same amount (USD value) of both of your chosen tokens and approve the spend on the pair.

After the transaction is successful, you will be provided with the corresponding LP tokens.

Head to TOAD.network and find the corresponding farm for your LP tokens. Approve the farm (so that you can provide liquidity), enter the amount you want to place, and click on ´deposit.´ Once you approve the deposit, you will start earning TOAD! The amount of TOAD you will earn is based on the amount of LP tokens you provided, the current amount of TOAD available, and the percentage of the farm that you own.

If you find any issues with using the PancakeSwap interface, TOAD.Network has you covered. TOAD DEVS cloned the PancakeSwap V1 site and have made that clone available on another site that you can use for the same purpose. Follow these steps for that clone:

##**Providing liquidity for TOAD on the PCS clone**
- Navigate to TOAD.network site. Expand the "trade" menu and click on PancakeSwap:

- Once you are on the cloned site, you will be prompted with a warning that anyone can create a token. The link provided is configured to automatically choose the right option to provide swap/liquidity. For your safety, you will be able to double check the TOAD token address (0x463e737d8f740395abf44f7aac2d9531d8d539e9) to confirm you are sending your tokens to the correct address.

- Mark the "I understand" checkbox and click "Continue".

Congrats!!! You have created your liquidity Pool tokens. Now you can head to [toad.network](https://toad.network/) and place the [liquidity](liquidity.md) on a [farm](farms.md) to earn some TOAD!

##**Adding the LP tokens to a farm**
- Head to [TOAD.network](https://toad.network/), expand the "products menu" option and click on "Farms."

![Navigate to Farms](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/_media/howtos/AddingLiquidity13a_navigateToFarms.png?raw=true)

- Connect your wallet to the site. (in the example, we are using Metamask as the preferred wallet).

![Connect wallet to DAPP](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/_media/howtos/AddingLiquidity13_connectWallet.png?raw=true)

- Once you have choosen the right farm, you will have to approve it on the DAPP so that you can place your LP tokens there.

![Approve Farm](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/_media/howtos/AddingLiquidity14_approveTheFarm.png?raw=true)

- You will have to confirm the spend in your wallet.

![Confirm approval on wallet](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/_media/howtos/AddingLiquidity15_confirmApprovalOnWallet.png?raw=true)

- Once you have approved your spend in your wallet, you will be able to enter the input the amount of LP tokens you want to deposit. Enter the values and click on "Deposit".

![Deposit LP tokens](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/_media/howtos/AddingLiquidity16_depositLPTokens.png?raw=true)

- Again, you will be prompted to approve this spend on your wallet. This is done for your safety. Approve the transaction to deposit.

![Confirm deposit on wallet](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/_media/howtos/AddingLiquidity16_ApprovedepositOnWallet.png?raw=true)

- After approving the deposit on your wallet, and once the transaction has been confirmed on the BSC, you will see your deposited LP tokens updated on the farm.

![Check deposited LP tokens](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/_media/howtos/AddingLiquidity17_confirmDepositedTokens.png?raw=true)

Congrats!! You have now deposited your LP tokens into a [TOAD farm](toadfarms.md) and you will be earning new TOADS by the second!
