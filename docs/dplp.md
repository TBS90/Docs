#**LPF, what is lp farm?**

LP tokens farming is a new and experimental concept that we came up with, the goal of which is to decentralize the [liquidity](liquidity.md). In most projects, the team holds a large amount of [liquidity](liquidity.md) and promise to lock it for a certain period. At Toad we are going to give back all of our LP tokens to the community, allowing people to farm them. This also makes the project rug pull proof, as all of the LP tokens from the team are going to a farming pool that is going to drip slowly for those who are staking their tokens.

There is an amazing video that explains the full concept [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAMNJRaDaLk)

##**Why is LPF better than a dev lock?**

First we need to understand what is a DEV Lock, which is a mechanism by which projects tend to compensate the developers of a project. In essence, when a project is created, most of the times what happens is that part of the liquidity captured during the funding process (IFOs, ICOs, Launchpads…) is locked in an specific contract that is only accessible to the developers wallets, and that can be claimed by them only after a specified amount of time has been reached, hence the lock.

Most of the times, what this Dev Lock causes is that, developers, once they are able to claim their tokens, start to dump them when price has high values, draining the liquidity from the pool, diminishing the token value and damaging the standard users portfolio.

With LPF, what happens is that developers donate the [liquidity](liquidity.md) collected and have it stored in a special contract that allows any user to connect to. This contract behaves exactly as any other standard pool contract, with an interesting difference: the return of the investment is the same LP token that is provided to the farm, instead of the native token for the project.

This LP Farming is the basis of the **Decentralised Perpetual Liquidity Protocol** that TOAD has brought to the cryptoverse.

It allows any user to keep increasing their position on the project just by reinvesting their recently earned LP tokens, saving time and transactions to the customer.

The **DPLP** protocol aims to make DeFi ecosystem safer by enabling a new mechanism to provide and maintain [liquidity](liquidity.md).

Designed for long term investors, **DPLP** requires a higher percent fee on entrance and exit, avoiding standard whale behavior of entering, earning quick gains and leaving the farm with all the liquidity drained.

In few words, LP farming contract will charge a 10% fee on deposits, reinvests and withdraws.

By charging a high fee to get in and out (that goes right back to the div pool), we ensure that the div pool never will run out of dividends.
Users who keep their liquidity locked in the contract the longest are the ones who are going to get the most rewards.

On the basis, this works as follows:
Let’s say that users start to remove their tokens from the contract as they have reached the expected gains or the pool isn’t attractive for them anymore, then the div pool will receive the exit fee from the users leaving, becoming, again bigger on dividends amount and making it more attractive for people to stake LP tokens and therefore, having again more users into providing [liquidity](liquidity.md).

These LP Mechanism will ensure TOAD and PAD will always have enough [liquidity](liquidity.md).

The TOAD LPF liquidity is hosted on PCS V1 liquidity contracts, while PAD’s has had its own personalised and audited contract specifically setup to correct PCS V1 liquidity limits and is fully managed by the [padswap](padswap.md) ecosystem.

Both of them have a 10% fee deposit, 10% Fee Withdraw (1% of which is burned).

TOAD developers donated their initially reserved LP tokens to the TOAD pool, and there is no way it can be removed but by farming it when providing [liquidity](liquidity.md) and joining to the LP Farm.

TOAD.Network invented perpetual liquidity and harnessed to farm donated developer shares.

By joining the pool your 10% tax is added to pool rewards and drip. When users leave the pool, they incur in the same 10% pool tax (except 9% reflects back to pool and 1% is burnt). This creates a system in which [liquidity](liquidity.md) will never expire. In 10, 25, and 150 years due to natural free market incentives there will still be liquid TOAD available to acquire.
