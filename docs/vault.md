## The Vault

**The Vault** is another breaking idea for the whole ToadNetwork-PadSwap ecosystem. It is conceived as a secure place that stores the backing for PAD, the native token of [PadSwap](padswap.md).

Whenever a swap takes place on PadSwap, 0.05% of the transaction goes to [the Vault](https://dapps.padswap.exchange/vault).  
The tokens accumulated in [the Vault](https://dapps.padswap.exchange/vault) act as a backing for PAD, giving it real value in underlying tokens, such as BNB, BTC, ETH and others. Essentially, PAD is backed by small amounts of every token on [PadSwap](padswap.md), and the backing amount is growing with every transaction.

At any time, any holder can burn their PAD, permanently removing them from the supply, and receive their backing - for instance, burning 1% of PAD supply will give you exactly 1% of what's stored in [the Vault](https://dapps.padswap.exchange/vault).
If PAD's market cap ever drops below its Vault backing, it will become profitable to burn your PAD, which will swiftly bring the price back up.

Its whole purpose is to behave as an automated “price correction mechanism”, enabling holders to retrieve the corresponding amount of pad tokens burnt in the form of the LP Tokens held in [the Vault](https://dapps.padswap.exchange/vault) at that moment.

“It works like a water wheel on a river, or other constant perpetual motion machine. The more volume the more rewards, enticing more volume which brings more rewards.”

**How The Vault works**

In the future, when [the Vault](https://dapps.padswap.exchange/vault) is filled enough, if a big dump happens on PAD price, for some brief time [the Vault](https://dapps.padswap.exchange/vault) will be paying more than the value of pad on swap, so there will be an opportunity for arbitrage on PAD price.

People can arbitrage by buying PAD on [PadSwap](padswap.md) and burnt it to profit of this condition.

When that happens, PAD price will go up influenced by standard AMM rules:
- increased buying pressure for the arbitrage
- supply decrease due to the burn

These two actions will be pushing the price above the backing price again

In other words, we can see [the Vault](https://dapps.padswap.exchange/vault) as a cross chain index forever rising, floating peg.

In most of AMMs, part of the swap fee goes towards Developer wallets.
In padswap, this portion is aimed to further reward all users by sending 0.05% of each swap to the [the Vault](https://dapps.padswap.exchange/vault) where PADs’ backing value is held.

It is a better rewarding feature than distributing dividends because PAD accumulates all historical profits + all future ones. Once someone buy pad it is not only buying pad's future profits but all historic ones in oppose to a token that pays dividends.

So, in broad words, [the Vault](https://dapps.padswap.exchange/vault) is fed through fees from swaps, farms, and any additional inflows that get added over time. These fees are held in the vault and also used to buy other cryptos, effectively forming a crypto index. If the open market price of pad dips below its backing, users can burn pad to redeem their share of the vault in the form of the LP tokens held there.

Example for burning Pad with easy numbers. Say there are 100 pad in existence and I choose to burn 1, I will get 1% (1/100) of whatever is in [the Vault](https://dapps.padswap.exchange/vault) at that time. If there were 100 Toad, 1 BTC, 10 ETH, and 1000 BUSD, I would get 1 Toad, 0.01 BTC, 0.1 ETH and 10 BUSD. The supply of PAD is forever reduced and all future fees and value in the vault is now shared among fewer tokens.
