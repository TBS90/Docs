## The Vault

**The Vault** is a secure place that stores the backing for PAD, the native token of [PadSwap](padswap.md).

Whenever a swap takes place on PadSwap, 0.05% of the transaction goes to [the Vault](https://dapps.padswap.exchange/vault).  
The tokens accumulated in the Vault act as a backing for PAD, giving it real value in underlying tokens, such as BNB, BTC, ETH and others. Essentially, PAD is backed by small amounts of every token on PadSwap, and the backing amount is growing with every transaction.

At any time, any holder can burn their PAD, permanently removing them from the supply, and receive their backing - for instance, burning 1% of PAD supply will give you exactly 1% of what's stored in the Vault.
If PAD's market cap ever drops below its Vault backing, it will become profitable to burn your PAD, which will swiftly bring the price back up.
