#**How to provide Liquidity in padswap.exchange DAPP**

**PAD Token liquidity**

If you are planning to build strong positions on the [padswap](padswap.md) ecosystem, then you are on the right place!

Head to [liquidity](liquidity.md) for more details about liquidity.

Depending on the farms you are wanting to be, you'll have to provide liquidity on a different pair of tokens.

There are some other videos also that might help on the topic, you'll find them below:

If you want to provide liquidity on the [toad](toadfarms.md) farms, head to [Add liquidity on ToadNetwork](addLiquitidyForTOADNetwork.md) to get some good details about how it is done.

#**How to add liquidity to padswap.exchange Farms**

[PAD](padtoken.md) has its liquidity on custom audited smart contracts developed by the ToadNetwork team following the secure design of the  PadSwap Liquidity Pool contract.

In broad words, liquidity is provided in a few steps:

Head to the "pool" area of "trade" on [padswap.exchange](https://padswap.exchange/#/pool), you'll have to provide same amount (USD value) of both of the chosen tokens and approve the spend on the pair.

After the transaction succeeds, you'll be provided with the corresponding LP tokens.

Now go to the farms on [padswap.exchange](https://dapps.padswap.exchange/) and look for the corresponding farm of your LP tokens, approve the farm (so that you can provide liquidity), write down the amount you want to place and click on deposit. Once you have approved the deposit, you'll start earning PADS by the second, based on the amount of LP tokens you provided, the current amount of PADS available and the percentage of the pool that you own.

Let's look into a more detailed view on what needs to be done.

##**Providing liquidity for PADSWAP**
- Navigate to [padswap.exchange](https://padswap.exchange) site, expand the "trade" menu and click on "liquidity":

![add liquidity](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/_media/howtos/PadSwapAddingLiquidity01_navigateToLiquidity.png?raw=true)

- In order to create your Liquidity Pool tokens, you will have to provide the same value of each token (head to  [liquidity](liquidity.md) to get a better understanding about this). If it is the first time you are trading any of those tokens, you will have to approve that padswap can spend them first.

![introduce amount of tokens for liquidity](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/_media/howtos/PadSwapAddingLiquidity02_ChooseTokensForLiquidity.png?raw=true)

- If is that first time, you'll have to confirm the transaction on your wallet in order to spend the token.

Congrats!!! You have created your liquidity Pool tokens. Now it is time to head to the farms area of [padswap.exchange](https://dapps.padswap.exchange/) and place the [liquidity](liquidity.md) on a [farm](padfarms.md) to earn some toads!

##**Adding the LP tokens to a farm**
