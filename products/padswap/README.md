## How does PADSwap compare to centralized exchanges?

Centralized exchanges (CEXs) like Binance, Coinbase, Kraken or Crypto.com offer a one-stop-shop solution with wallet, exchange, fiat conversion and other features tightly integrated into a single multiplatform application. Newcomer therefore often start trading crypto on these platforms.

Compared to these old centralized exchanges, PADSwap offers benefits like being non-custodial, permissionless and using an Automated Market Maker (AMM) over an order book.

### Non-custodial

Custodial exchanges like centralized exchanges are like banks. They hold and handle your tokens. You need to trust them to not withhold your tokens.

PADSwap is non-custodial, which means that‚Äîunlike centralized exchanges‚ÄîPADSwap does not need to possess your tokens in order for you to be able to trade them. Instead, PADSwap allows users to trade tokens from their wallet like [MetaMask](https://metamask.io) or [Trust Wallet](https://trustwallet.com/de/) via [liquidity-pools.md](liquidity-pools.md "mention").

### Permissionless

Centralized exchanges restrict their services to certain geographies and to selected people e.g. only of certain age.&#x20;

On PADSwap anyone can use our swap, provide liquidity or stake in our farms. TOAD.Networks products are open for public use without restrictions for anyone.&#x20;

### Automated Market Maker (AMM)

With liquidity that is supplied by other users. This means that new projects can easily connect to their desired markets as long as some entity is willing to provide the liquidity.
