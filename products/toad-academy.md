# ðŸ•¹ TOAD Academy

[Toad Academy](https://toad.academy/) is a side project of TOAD Network, aimed at combining **education** and **fun**.

Our goal is to familiarize people with difficult crypto-related concepts in intuitive and interactive ways.

On the [Toad Academy](https://toad.academy/) website, you'll see two categories - [Apps](https://toad.academy/toolbox/) and [Games](https://toad.academy/games/)

[Apps](https://toad.academy/toolbox/) are more technical, and will allow you to better understand things like **impermanent loss** on LP tokens or **compounding your stake** for better returns.

[Games](https://toad.academy/games/) are more light-hearted. Some of them have educational elements (our [brick breaker game](https://toadgames.github.io/BrickBreaker/ is a good example), and some are just a way to take a break have some fun.

Like everything in the TOAD ecosystem, Toad Academy is evolving, with new content added regularly and existing content being updated.

Our end goal is to reach a point where anyone can understand the most difficult concepts effortlessly and in the most entertaining way.
