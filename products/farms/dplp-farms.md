**ALL DPLP Farms have a 10% fee deposit, 10% Fee Withdraw**

All [PADSwap](../padswap/) DPLP farms return 7.5% into the rewards pool and send 2.5% to [The Vault](../../concepts/the-vault.md) to back [PAD](../../tokens/pad.md). The Original TOAD DPLP has 1% burned, the other 9% returning to the rewards pool.

TOAD developers donated their initially reserved LP tokens to the TOAD pool. There is no way these tokens can be removed except by farming it when providing liquidity and joining to the LP Farm.

TOAD.Network invented the Decentralized Perpetual Liquidity Protocol so that users can farm donated developer shares and ensure perpetual liquidity for the TOAD.Network ecosystem.

By joining the pool, your 10% fee is added to pool rewards and drip. When users leave the pool, they incur in the same 10% fee refilling the rewards pool. This creates a system in which liquidity will never expire. In 10, 25, even 150 years, due to natural free market incentives, there will still be liquid [TOAD](../../tokens/toad.md) and [PAD](../../tokens/pad.md) available to purchase.
