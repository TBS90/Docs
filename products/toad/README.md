# üê∏ TOAD

OG medium discussion and rugpull centric discussion goes here



**TOAD Token**

Toad token was released on the BSC on Friday, 26th of February 2021 with a fixed amount of 200.000 TOAD tokens. At launch 5,000 were burnt.

There is no possibility to mint more TOAD.

Conceived as a governance token, has a very low supply, and will see significant buyback pressure from The Vault.

TOAD aims to empower the [TOAD.Network](broken-reference) community to participate in the protocol decisions, like:

‚Ä¢ Bring and vote on new proposals.

‚Ä¢ Determine fee ratios directed to both the Vault and farms/pools rewards.&#x20;

‚Ä¢ Marketing / Development endeavors.
