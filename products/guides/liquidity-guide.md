**PAD Token liquidity**

If you are planning to build strong positions on the PADSwap ecosystem, then you are in the right place!

Head to liquidity for more details about liquidity.

Depending on the farms you want to enter, you may have to provide liquidity on a different pair of tokens.

Here are some videos that might help on the topic:

If you want to provide liquidity on the TOAD farms, head to [Add liquidity on ToadNetwork](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/addLiquitidyForTOADNetwork.md) to find more information.

## How to add liquidity to PADSwap.Exchange Farms

[PAD](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/padtoken.md) holds liquidity on custom audited smart contracts developed by the TOAD.Network team following the secure design of the PadSwap Liquidity Pool contract.

To provide liquidity:

Head to the "pool" area of "trade" on [padswap.exchange](https://padswap.exchange/#/pool). You will have to provide same amount (USD value) of both of your chosen tokens and approve the spend on the pair.

After the transaction is successful, you will be provided with the corresponding LP tokens.

Now go to the "farms" on [padswap.exchange](https://dapps.padswap.exchange) and find the corresponding farm for your LP token. Approve the farm (so that you can provide liquidity), enter the amount you want to place and click on "deposit." Once you have approved the deposit, you will start earning PAD. The amount of PAD you will earn is based on the amount of LP tokens you provided, the current amount of PAD available, and the percentage of the farm that you own.

## Providing liquidity for PADSWAP

* Navigate to [padswap.exchange](https://padswap.exchange) site, expand the "trade" menu and click on "liquidity":

![add liquidity](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/\_media/howtos/PadSwapAddingLiquidity01\_navigateToLiquidity.png?raw=true)

* In order to create your Liquidity Pool tokens, you will have to provide the same value of each token (head to [liquidity](broken-reference) to get more information on this topic). If this is the first time you are trading any of these tokens, you will have to approve PADSwap to spend them before you continue.

![introduce amount of tokens for liquidity](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/\_media/howtos/PadSwapAddingLiquidity02\_ChooseTokensForLiquidity.png?raw=true)

* If this is your first time trading these tokens, you will have to confirm the transaction in your wallet in order to spend the token.

![approve spend on wallet](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/\_media/howtos/PadSwapAddingLiquidity03\_approveToken1.png?raw=true)

* After approving the spend of the tokens, click on the "Supply" button of the site.

![click on supply button](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/\_media/howtos/PadSwapAddingLiquidity06\_supplyLiquidity.png?raw=true)

Congrats!!! You have created your liquidity Pool tokens. Now it is time to head to the "farms" area of [padswap.exchange](https://dapps.padswap.exchange) and place the [liquidity](broken-reference) on a [farm](broken-reference) to earn some PAD!

\##**Adding the LP tokens to a farm**

* Head to [padswap.exchange](https://dapps.padswap.exchange) site and click on Farms.

![Navigate to Farms](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/\_media/howtos/PadSwapAddingLiquidity16\_putLPTokensOnFarm.png?raw=true)

* Connect your wallet to the site. (in the example we are using Metamask as the preferred wallet).

![Connect wallet to Dapp](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/\_media/howtos/AddingLiquidity13\_connectWallet.png?raw=true)

* Once you have choosen the right farm, you will have to approve it on the DAPP so that you can deposit your LP tokens.

* You will have to confirm the spend in your wallet.

![Confirm approval on wallet](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/\_media/howtos/PadSwapAddingLiquidity19\_approveFarmOnWallet.png?raw=true)

![Confirm deposit on wallet](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/\_media/howtos/PadSwapAddingLiquidity21\_confirmDepositOnWallet.png?raw=true)

* After approving the deposit on your wallet, and once the transaction has been confirmed on the BSC, you will see your deposited LP tokens updated on the farm.

![Check deposited LP tokens](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/\_media/howtos/PadSwapAddingLiquidity22\_checkDepositedTokens.png?raw=true)

Congrats! You have now deposited your LP tokens into a PAD farm and you'll be earning new PAD by the second!
