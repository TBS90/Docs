# How to Swap

**PADSwapping**

PADSwap has also some liquidity pools available for swaps. If you want to check which of them are available, you can check at [padswap pairs stats](https://info.padswap.exchange/pairs) for the available ones.

Apart from the well known tokens (BTC, ETH and, of course, BNB), there are some partners tokens already in there, all available to swap and also, of course, to provide [liquidity](broken-reference) to. Remember that, for every swap that happens on PADSwap, part of the fee (a total of 0.3%) is redirected to the liquidity providers (0.25%) and the rest (0.05%) is redirected to [The Vault](../padswap/the-vault.md), making the ecosystem much safer and stable.

PADSwap smart contracts are the safest and fairest smart contracts you'll ever find, as they are build with donated liquidity from the DEVS and reward liquidity providers which are farming this liquidity with the highest percent in the blockchain.

There are some other videos also that might help on the topic, you'll find them below:

## How to swap tokens padswap.exchange

[PAD](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/padtoken.md) has its liquidity on custom audited smart contracts developed by the ToadNetwork team following the secure design of the PadSwap Liquidity Pool contract.

In broad words, here is how to swap any token available within the padswap project:

Head to the "exchange" area of "trade" on [padswap.exchange](https://padswap.exchange/#/swap), connect your wallet, choose the source token on the upper list and the amount you want to swap. Select the destination token you want to receive and the dapp will automaticalliy calculate the corresponding amount based on the AMM rules. If you are happy with the swap, click on swap. A detailed transaction screen will be presented, accept the proposal and then approve the transaction in you wallet.

After the transaction succeeds, you'll be provided with the corresponding tokens.

Let's look into a more detailed view on what needs to be done.

* In order to swap tokens, choose it from the dropDown menu and introduce the amount you want to swap. If it is the first time you are trading any of those tokens, you will have to approve that padswap can spend them first.

* If is that first time, you'll have to confirm the transaction on your wallet in order to spend the token.

* You'll notice that, after approving in your wallet, the dapp will wait for the approval to happen.

* After approving the spend of the tokens, click on the "swap" button of the site.

![click on supply button](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/\_media/howtos/SwappingOnPadswap06\_chooseSwapToken.png?raw=true)

* Once you click on "swap", you'll get an informational screen with details on the different values you are providing and requested to confirm the operation.

![Confirm tokens swap](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/\_media/howtos/SwappingOnPadswap07\_CheckSwapDetails.png?raw=true)

* Again, you'll be prompted in your wallet if you want to approve the proposed swap, which you'll confirm by accepting.

![approve swap on wallet](https://github.com/ToadNetwork/Docs/blob/main/docs/\_media/howtos/SwappingOnPadswap08\_confirmSwapOnWallet.png?raw=true)

* You'll notice a small pop up rising on top of the swap screen, informing you that the transaction has been sent to the blockchain for registration.

* After the confirmation and the transaction success on the BSC, your be returned to the "swap window", and you'll notice that the amount of each token on the display has been updated to reflect your balance.

Congrats!!! You have managed to perform your first swap on PadSwap. Now it is time to head to the farms area of [padswap.exchange](https://dapps.padswap.exchange) and place the tokens you swap on a farm to earn some fresh PAD!
