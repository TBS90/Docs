# ðŸš€ LaunchPAD

LaunchPAD beta will allow anyone to launch their own project without any coding experience. Any project created on LaunchPAD beta will start with:

AUDITED Presale Contract

AUDITED BEP20 or MOVR Token

AUDITED Farms (TOKEN-BNB|MOVR, TOKEN-BUSD|USDC, TOKEN-PAD)&#x20;

AUDITED DPLP FARMS (DECENTRALIZED PERPETUAL LIQUIDITY PROTOCOL)&#x20;

Partner Farms available for whitelisted Projects

RUG-PROOF PROJECT BATCH

Discounted Moonlight Bubble Maps List

Free Unifaucet List

LaunchPAD beta will receive a percentage of every presale and a small fee for creating the project, those fees are going to be converted to TOAD/BNB | TOAD/MOVR | TOAD/GLMR and donated to DPLP.

The main idea is to make token launches as safe as possible for users and as easy as possible for developers while also offering a large variety of utility tools to boost their liquidity. Developers should be able to focus on their products and the community. This will set a industry standard where they feel safe Developers won't be able to rug or act maliciously with funds. Obviously this isn't a magic solution, bad projects that don't offer anything new are still going to do poorly. However this is leaps above current protocols and eliminates rug pulling.&#x20;
