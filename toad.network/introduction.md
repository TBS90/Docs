# ðŸ‘‹ Introduction

## What is TOAD?&#x20;

TOAD is a community-driven organization built to solve the common problems of Decentralized Finance. These problems include the inability of disparate forms of liquidity to connect with markets in a decentralized way; and even the issues of removing liquidity provision from projects (Rug-Pulling). Some solutions provide incrementally progressive advances toward solving the problem of liquidity, but TOAD.Network's progress is intended to initiate a broader, more impactful range of network effects. Rather than limiting itself to a single solution, TOAD.Network intertwines many decentralized markets and instruments.&#x20;

Thus far, the [**core products**](broken-reference), include a decentralized exchange ([**PADSwap.Exchange**](https://dapps.padswap.exchange)), yield farms ([**Farms**](../products/padswap/yield-farming.md)), and a new token Launchpad ([**LaunchPAD**](https://dapps.padswap.exchange/launchpad)). TOAD.Network's products are configured in a way that allows the entire platform to maintain decentralized governance by TOAD token holders, while continuing to innovate on the collective foundations. Whereas major structural changes are voted on by the community, the day-to-day operations, rebalancing of pools and ratios, business strategy, and overall development is ultimately decided on by KT, Snake and the [**Core Team**](meet-the-team.md).&#x20;

The following documentation details the functional and technical aspects of the ecosystem products.&#x20;
