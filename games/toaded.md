Toaded is a strategic war card game, where the ultimate goal is to manage and attack the opposing player directly via one of your soldiers to win the round. It requires 2 out of 3 rounds to win a game; and 2 out of 3 games to win a match. Whether you prefer to go all in with the mightiest of warriors or stall your opponent until they’re out of resources, this game has it all and everything in between. Dive into a continuously expanding pool of cards and build the best deck that suits your strategic vision.
