Toad token was released on the BSC on Friday, 26th of February 2021 with a fixed amount of 200.000 TOAD tokens. At launch 5,000 were burnt. There is no possibility to mint more TOAD.

The Vault takes 30% off all the fees it receives and buys TOAD with it. This adds significant buyback pressure, meaning, that the Vault generates demand for TOAD and thereby increasing the price. Since the Vault stores the bought TOAD, it basically removes them from circulation, which in turn decreases the supply.&#x20;
