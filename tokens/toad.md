# üê∏ $TOAD

* **Name:** Toad
* **Symbol/Ticker:** TOAD
* **Max Supply:** 200k

Toad token was released on the BSC on Friday, 26th of February 2021 with a fixed amount of 200.000 TOAD tokens. At launch 5,000 were burnt.

There is no possibility to mint more TOAD.

Conceived as a governance token, has a very low supply, and will see significant buyback pressure from The Vault.

TOAD aims to empower the TOAD.Network community to participate in the protocol decisions, like:

* Bring and vote on new proposals.
* Determine fee ratios directed to both the Vault and farms/pools rewards.
* Marketing / Development endeavors.

Benefits to TOAD holders: Lots of farms for TOAD pairs. Vault buys 30% of the fees generated in TOAD and stores them, removing tokens from circulation. Increase TOAD liquidity (with lots of new TOAD farms we can expect the amount of liquidity to increase a lot)
