## Max Supply

## Minting

Increasing the total supply of a token by releasing new tokens. If a token has a max supply, then the number of tokens which can be minted is limited by the max supply. If there is no max supply, the token can be minted infinitely and is therefore considered to be an inflationary token.&#x20;

{% endhint %}

## Pegging

If the price of one asset is bound to the price of another asset(s).

Stable coins like BUSD are one example of pegging. Since BUSD is pegged by USD, you expect 1 BUSD will always have the same value as 1 USD.

## Staking

If you put your tokens into a pool (e.g. a farm) then you effectively own a share of that pool. In other words, you have a stake in the pool. The process of you suppling your tokens to the pool is therefore called staking.
